                    A galaxy is an assembly of stars (hydrogen, helium, oxygen, carbon, ...), dark interstellar matter
                    (heavy elements in the form of dust), gas (hydrogen, helium) and probably large quantities of dark
                    matter (unknown matter), whose cohesion is ensured by gravitational forces.<br><br><br> The gaseous
                    matter
                    forms
                    a spherical halo much larger than the galaxy itself.<br>
                    <br>
                    <br><br><br><br> The mass of an average galaxy is of an
                    order of
                    magnitude greater than <i>hundred million solar masses.</i> Galaxies interact with their neighbors
                    and
                    these interactions change their shape. Two galaxies can sometimes merge.<br>

            Our Milky Way

        </h1>
        <i>Space is immense, but the space between the gravitational zones of the 100 billion stars in our Milky Way is
            relatively small.<br><br>
            The closest star to the Sun is only 4.24 light-years away, it is called Proxima Centauri or α Centauri C,
            but it is not a bright star, it is a red dwarf of absolute magnitude +15.49 and apparent magnitude +11.05,
            which seems to revolve around its two neighbors, α Centauri A and α Centauri B. Its luminosity in visible
            light is equal to 0.0056% of that of the Sun, it radiates almost all its light energy (85%) in the infrared.
            For a star to shine it must produce nuclear reactions in its center. For this it must reach a minimum mass,
            8% of the mass of the Sun (M☉).<br> Below this mass, they are brown dwarfs or planets. Proxima Centauri with
            a
            mass equal to 12% of M☉, shines slightly. It will exist long after the Sun because it consumes very little
            fuel and will shine faintly for tens of billions of years. Due to its proximity, α Centauri A is the fourth
            brightest star in the night sky, after Sirius, Canopus and Arcturus, it is a yellow dwarf of spectral type
            G2V. G means that it is a yellow dwarf whose surface temperature is between 5300 K and 6000 K, like our Sun.
            What is a light year?
        </i>
        <h2>What does represent one light year ?</h2>
        <i>
            A light year is ≈10,000 billion km. This distance seems very large, but the Oort cloud, a region of the
            solar system, is ≈7500 billion km away and contains billions of icy bodies at the edge of the Sun's
            attraction.<br>
            Gravitation is a universal force that bends space at very long distances. The gravitational influence of the
            Sun is therefore "limitless", however it gradually decreases, until another mass bends space towards it, and
            imposes its gravitational attraction.<br><br><br>
            The closest stars to the Sun are located about 4 light years away, this is the Alpha Centauri system, this
            system is twice as massive (≈2.13 M☉) as the solar system.
            At what distance, the gravitational confrontation between these two massive objects, will therefore take
            place?<br>
            In other words, where is the limit of influence of our Sun?<br><br><br>
            Although these two objects do not rotate around each other we could use r ≈ a√3(m/3M) which is the
            simplified formula of the Hill sphere, r being the radius of the Hill sphere and a the semi-major axis.
            Thus to get an idea of this gravitational boundary we write in Excel:
            =4,24*((1/(3*2,13))^(1/3))
            The radius of the Hill sphere of the Alpha Centauri system (heaviest object) is ≈ 4.24 multiplied by the
            cube root of (m/3M) = 2.28 light years.<br>
            The gravitational influence zone of our solar system thus dies at about 4.24 - 2.28 = 1.96 light years. A
            celestial object (dwarf or floating exoplanet) could remain in the vicinity of this boundary, between the
            two systems, without being captured by one of the two.<br>

                What is a Black Hole ?

            </h1>
            <i>Not all stars shine, the universe is home to dark stars.<br> Black holes are massive objects whose
                gravitational field is so intense that it prevents any form of matter or radiation from escaping.<br>
                Black holes are described by the general theory of relativity. When the core of a dead star is too
                massive to become a neutron star, it inexorably contracts until it forms the mysterious astronomical
                object that is the black hole.<br><br>
                Stellar black holes have a mass of a few solar masses to billions of solar masses. They are born as a
                result of the gravitational collapse of the residue of massive stars.<br> When the combustion by
                thermonuclear reactions in the core of the massive star ends, for lack of fuel, a supernova appears.
                This supernova can leave behind a core that continues to collapse rapidly.<br>
                A man predicted already in the 18th century, the existence of dark stars, the British physicist,
                astronomer and geologist, John Michell (1724 - 1793).<br><br>


                In his notes he wrote that when a star becomes too massive, it attracts light under the influence of its
                gravitational force. However, as his calculations give a density of the star corresponding to 18 billion
                tons in one cm3, he concludes that this cannot exist.
                <br>
                Today, the theory of black holes, states that they are objects so dense that their speed of release is
                greater than the speed of light.
                <br>
                The light can not overcome the gravitational force of surface and remains trapped.
                The theory also defines precisely the intensity of the gravitational field of a black hole. It is such
                that no particle crossing its horizon, theoretical boundary, can escape.

            <h1 id="Quasars">
                <img src="images/Galaxy/Quasars.jpg" width="100%" height="100%"></img>
                What is a Quasars ?

            </h1>
            <i>Quasars (Quasi Stellar Radio-sources) are radio sources that correspond to galaxy nuclei (black holes)
                that are located at very large distances, several billion light years.<br>
                Quasars no longer exist today, so they shine from the distant past.<br><br>
                Quasars are the brightest objects in the Universe but appear as strange faint stars. Images of these
                faint areas seen by the CFHT (Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope), show, when the signal corresponding to
                the quasar is subtracted, a resulting image that looks like an elliptical galaxy.<br><br>
                Quasars can be observed in the electromagnetic spectrum of radio waves, infrared, visible light,
                ultraviolet, X-rays and gamma rays.<br><br>
                Quasars radiate strongly and have a brightness that appears to come from hundreds of galaxies, but a
                quasar is about a million times smaller than an ordinary galaxy. Because of the strength of their
                radiation, and their frequent changes, quasars were once thought to be relatively close and faint
                objects, rather than distant and powerful ones.<br><br>


                The emission of quasars is strongly redshifted, that is to say that they move away at very high speed
                from the Milky Way, according to Hubble's law (v=H0d where the Hubble constant H0=73 km/s/Mpc).
                Most of the radio emission from quasars seems to come from a bright core of a few light-years in
                diameter at most.<br>
                Radio galaxies and quasars can be detected at great distances because they are extremely powerful radio
                sources. These signals from distant radio sources take a long time to reach the Earth, which is why
                radio astronomers can see the Universe as it appeared more than 10 billion years ago, going back in time
                to the origins of the Universe.<br><br> They hope to see the famous moment of the primordial explosion,
                the Big
                Bang.<br>
