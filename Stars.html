                A star is a very hot ball of gas: several million degrees at the center (temperature sufficient to
                trigger nuclear reactions), several thousand degrees at the surface.<br>
                <br>


                In a star, the balance is obtained between two opposite forces: gravity precipitates the matter towards
                the center while the pressure pushes this matter away. The life span of stars is limited: when they have
                transformed all their hydrogen into helium (which takes several billion years), they swell and become
                red giants.
                <br><br>

                Depending on their initial mass, they will then die quietly as white dwarfs or spectacularly as
                supernovas; in the latter case their agony may even lead them to the stage of black holes.

            <i>Space is immense, but the space between the gravitational zones of the 100 billion stars in our Milky Way
                is
                relatively small.<br>
                <br>
                The closest star to the Sun is only 4.24 light-years away, it is called Proxima Centauri or α Centauri
                C,
                but it is not a bright star, it is a red dwarf of absolute magnitude +15.49 and apparent magnitude
                +11.05,
                which seems to revolve around its two neighbors, α Centauri A and α Centauri B.
                <br><br> Its luminosity in
                visible
                light is equal to 0.0056% of that of the Sun, it radiates almost all its light energy (85%) in the
                infrared.<br><br>
                For a star to shine it must produce nuclear reactions in its center. For this it must reach a minimum
                mass,
                8% of the mass of the Sun (M☉). Below this mass, they are brown dwarfs or planets.
                <br> Proxima Centauri with
                a
                mass equal to 12% of M☉, shines slightly. It will exist long after the Sun because it consumes very
                little
                fuel and will shine faintly for tens of billions of years. Due to its proximity, α Centauri A is the
                fourth
                brightest star in the night sky, after Sirius, Canopus and Arcturus, it is a yellow dwarf of spectral
                type
                G2V.<br> It means that it is a yellow dwarf whose surface temperature is between 5300 K and 6000 K, like
                our
                Sun.

                Our Sun is pretty impressive, but how does it compare to other stars? There are billions more stars
                in the Milky Way galaxy<br> - the galaxy we call home. And there are many, many more in the rest of the
                universe. Is our Sun special?<br><br><br>



                It turns out that our Sun is an average sized star.<br> There are bigger stars, and there are smaller
                stars. We have found stars that are 100 times bigger in diameter than our sun.<br> Truly, those stars
                are enormous. We have also seen stars that are just one tenth the size of our sun.<br><br>
                Our Sun is an ordinary star — just one of billions of stars in our galaxy alone.<br> However, as our own
                star, the Sun holds special status for us and is essential to our existence.<br><br> The Sun's gravity
                holds the
                solar system together, and nuclear fusion within the Sun supplies the energy for life on Earth.<br>
                Without
                the Sun, Earth would be a drastically different place.<br>

                Most of us live by our calendars to keep track of our schedules.<br><br>

                But did you know that the calendar has astronomical origins?<br><br>

                Constellations were largely created to help people remember the important patterns the stars make, but
                they have many other uses, including the formation of the calendar.<br>

                For example, the ancient Egyptians watched the star then called Sopdet, known today in Canada as Sirius.
                Each year, when they saw Sopdet rise, they knew that the annual flooding of the Nile was approaching.

                This important information greatly affected their lives. It was the same for many people around the
                world.<br>
                The ancient Romans created a 12-month calendar based on the lunar months, the first of which was the one
                we call March.<br>

                The names of the ancient Roman months are as follows:

                appearance of a figure on the sky.<br> A constellation is therefore a particular asterism.<br><br>
                In the sky, the stars of a constellation are far apart but appear grouped in figures, so that the
                constellation
                has no distance of its own.<br> The western constellations are grouped into two parts, dividing the sky

                or
                less

                north.<br>
                The northern constellations are the oldest and correspond to the sky plan visible from the Mediterranean
                regions
                by the ancient astronomers. The southern constellations were named by Western astronomers after the 15th
                century.<br><br>
                The International Astronomical Union (IAU) divides the sky into 88 official constellations with precise
                boundaries, so that each point in the sky belongs to a constellation.<br> Man is fascinated by the

                is

                reality
                only
                2,600 are visible because of stray light.

                What is a Pulsars ?

            </h1>
            <i>Neutron stars are very small but very dense (1 billion tons per cubic centimeter).<br>
                They concentrate the mass of a star like the Sun in a radius of about 10 km, corresponding to what is
                called
                the
                Chandrasekhar mass.<br>
                They are the remains of very massive stars of more than ten solar masses. When a massive star comes to
                the
                end
                of its existence, it collapses on itself, producing an impressive explosion called supernova.<br><br>
                This
                explosion
                disperses huge amounts of matter into space but spares the core of the star. This core contracts and is
                transformed into a large part of a neutron star. These objects, called magnetars or magnetostars, have
                very
                intense magnetic fields.<br> Along the magnetic axis, charged particles, such as electrons, propagate
                and
                produce
                synchrotron radiation.
                If it rotates rapidly on itself, it projects a thin brush of radiation along its magnetic axis, which is
                called
                a pulsar.</i>
            <h3>Discovery of the first pulsar</h3>
            <i>Pulsars are corpses of stars, extremely dense dwarfs that turn on themselves much faster than other stars
                (10
                to
                1000 times per second).<br> Their light sweeps through space like a lighthouse. It was in 1967 with the
                radio
                telescope sensitive to flickers, that Jocelyne Bell, a student of Hewish, detected an anomaly in the
                swarming of
                radio waves: the scruff.<br><br> Jocelyne Bell searched for the scruff for months and discovered a
                series of
                regular
                pulses.
                These pulses seemed too regular to be natural. John Pilkington was able to measure the distance from the
                Earth
                to the pulsar, 1000 al.<br> This 1.33 second clock was too perfect to be a natural process. At first
                scientists
                wondered if this was not a sign of intelligence. Hewish, using the Doppler effect, put an end to this
                hope
                of
                signals from another civilization. Subsequently, several pulsars were discovered. The radio sources come
                from
                neutron stars and a pulsar is a fast rotating neutron star, corresponding to the collapsed core of a
                massive
                star that exploded as a supernova at the end of its life. In general the explosion of a supernova leaves
                a
                super
                compact celestial object in its heart called SNR (Super Nova Remnant).<br><br>
                It is the FGST (Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope) of Nasa that discovered for the first time a pulsar,
                whose
                name
                comes from the abbreviation of pulsating radio source. This fast rotating neutron star, on the image
                opposite,
                is 10 000 years old, it blinks about three times per second by expelling its gamma rays into space. Five
                French
                teams from IN2P3/CNRS, CEA/Irfu and Insu/CNRS participated in the analysis and interpretation of these
                results,
                published in the journal Science (La science Express, October 16, 2008). Astronomers have counted almost
                1800
                pulsars in the Milky Way, found thanks to their radio signals or their weak pulsations in visible light
                and
                X-rays.</i>

                mass

                6,300 light years from Earth, in the constellation Taurus. The nebula has a diameter of 11 light-years
                and
                its
                expansion speed is 1 500 km/s.<br><br> It is the first astronomical object to be identified with a
                supernova
                explosion.
                At the center of the nebula is a pulsar, a neutron star as massive as the Sun but only the size of a
                small
                city.<br><br>
                The Crab Pulsar rotates at a speed of 30 times per second. It radiates about 200,000 times more energy
                than
                the
                Sun and this in an extremely wide frequency range. A supernova is the visible phenomenon directly
                resulting
                from
                the cataclysmic explosion of a star which leads to its total destruction and thus to the death of the
                star.

                What is a Supernova ?

            </h1>
            <i>Red supergiants, the largest stars in the universe, are stars close to explosion because they have
                already
                consumed all their hydrogen, helium or carbon in successive nuclear reactions. Their equilibrium broken,
                the
                gravitational collapse of the core of the star continues and the explosion is imminent. The internal
                pressure of
                the core of the supergiant linked to the gravitational force is no longer in equilibrium with the
                pressure
                of
                nuclear radiation. At the same time as its core collapses, the outer layers of its envelope swell
                considerably
                and cool.<br><br>
                Betelgeuse (α Orionis) the red supergiant of the constellation Orion, is one of the largest known stars
                after
                Antares.<br><br> Betelgeuse is about 600 times larger than the Sun and shines like 100,000 suns. Only a
                few
                million
                years old, Betelgeuse is already nearing the end of its life. Like all supergiants, it consumes an
                enormous
                amount of matter in a very short time, about the mass of the Sun in only 10,000 years.<br><br> In a few
                thousand
                years,
                Betelgeuse will explode as a core-collapse supernova. People of that time will be able to see it from
                Earth,
                even in daylight.<br> A supernova is a new star, the term comes from the Latin "nova", which means
                "new".
                They
                appear suddenly in the sky and disappear after a few months. Supernovae are rare events in our Milky
                Way,
                about
                one to three per century, but on the scale of the universe, we observe them every day. Supernova
                explosions
                contribute to the chemical enrichment of the universe. It is during its supernova explosion that the
                star
                releases the chemical elements, which it has synthesized during its existence and during the explosion
                itself.<br><br>
                It is the stars at the end of their life, and in particular the supernovae that generate all the
                elements
                beyond
                iron. Iron is a stable element and the collapse of the supernova core stops when it is entirely made of
                iron.<br><br>
                Indeed the fusion of iron does not produce energy but consumes it, then the star running out of fuel,
                can
                not
                support the weight of the upper layers, which further compress the iron, the nuclei disintegrate and
                protons
                capture electrons to form neutrons. This new concentrated core of neutrons, incredibly compact, a few km
                in
                radius and the mass of the star, is then able to resist the pressure of the outer layers, which stops
                its
                collapse abruptly.


                The effect is cataclysmic, the layers of gas then "bounce" on the core.<br><br> The energy released by
                the
                layers
                falling towards the center, produces a shock wave that "blows" the outer layers of the star, this is
                called
                a
                supernova explosion.<br>
                The gaseous envelope that will be projected into space will release a considerable energy, as much
                energy as
                the
                Sun for billions of years. This terrible explosion, which projects the upper layers of the star into
                space,
                will
                be visible throughout the galaxy. Then a supernova will spread, over hundreds of billions of km, seeding
                the
                interstellar medium with heavy elements, manufactured during the life of the star and during the
                explosion.<br>
                These heavy elements are the constituents of the telluric planets, like our Earth and also the
                constituents
                of
                our body and of all the objects which surround us.
                The supernova of Tycho called SN 1572, is a nova that appeared in the constellation of Cassiopeia in
                1572.<br>
                It
                was visible to the naked eye and observed by Tycho Brahe on November 11, 1572, then brighter than the
                planet
                Venus.<br><br> Tycho Brahe noticed that the position of the object did not move in relation to the fixed
                stars,
                like
                the
                planets. He deduced that it was not a planet, but a star. In March 1574, it disappeared below the
                visibility
                threshold.<br> This superb image from the Chandra X-Ray Space Telescope is one of the most important
                images
                ever
                produced with an observatory in Earth orbit. It is as well known as the Crab Nebula supernova. The Crab
                Nebula
                (M1 or NGC 1952) is the result of the explosion of the supernova SN 1054 observed from July 1054 to
                April
                1056
                by a Chinese astronomer.<br> In 1758 Charles Messier discovered it and made it the first object in his
                catalog
                (M1
                in the Messier catalog).<br><br>
                Supernovas are indeed explosions of extremely luminous stars, so luminous that they are remarkable among
                the
                bright stars of a galaxy.
