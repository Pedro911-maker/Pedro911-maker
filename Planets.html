            This seemingly simple question doesn't have a simple answer.Everyone knows that Earth, Mars and Jupiter
            are planets.
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>But both Pluto and Ceres were once considered planets until new discoveries triggered
            scientific debate about how to best
            describe them—a vigorous debate that continues to this day.
            <br> The most recent definition of a planet was
            adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 2006. It says a planet must do three things:
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>





            <li>It must orbit a star (in our cosmic neighborhood, the Sun).</li>
            <br>
            <br>

            <li>It must be big enough to have enough gravity to force it into a spherical shape.</li>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <li>Finally, it must be big enough that its gravity cleared away any other objects of a similar size near
              its orbit
              around the Sun.</li>
            <br>
            <br>

            Discussion—and debate—will continue as our view of the cosmos continues to expand.

          Mercure

        </h1>
        <i>With a diameter of 4878 km, it is the smallest of the telluric planets. Located at only 58 million km from
          the
          Sun, it receives 6.7 more solar energy (per unit area) than the Earth. Mercury revolves around the Sun in 88
          days. Day and night last about 29 days each. Because there is no atmosphere, the temperature rises to more
          than
          400°C during the day and drops to -170°C at night.
          <br><br>
          Mercury is the closest planet to the sun and the smallest
          planet in the solar system. Its size
          is only slightly larger (28%) than our moon and their surface craters look very similar.
          <br>

          <br> It is
          visible from Earth just before sunrise or just after sunset. Mercury never moves
          more than 27 degrees from the Sun (this is the angle of the hands of a watch when it is one o'clock).
          Mercury is a mysterious planet that we are beginning to understand thanks to the Messenger probe.<br><br>
          Before
          Messenger, we
          knew only 45% of its surface in detail. It has no satellites.<br> Mercury has a very
          eccentric orbit which makes its radius vary from 46 to 70 million kilometers. Its name comes from the Roman
          god
          Mercury.
          <br></i>
        <h3>Lower Planet</h3>
        <i>


          <br> Mercury has a mantle (crust of silicates), relatively thin. Mercury has a large iron core with a radius
          of
          1800 to 1900 km. The silicate envelope (analogous to the terrestrial mantle and crust) is only 500 to 600 km.
          Mercury has a small magnetic field whose intensity is 1% of that of the Earth.
          Mercury has no satellite.

          Venus
        </h1>
        <i>With a diameter of 12,102 km, it is the planet whose size is closest to that of the Earth. It is located at
          108.200.000 km from the Sun of which it makes the turn in 224 days and 17 hours.<br><br>
          Venus has a very dense
          atmosphere (90 bars) essentially made up of carbon dioxide. It is permanently surrounded by a layer of
          sulfuric
          acid clouds. The greenhouse effect is so important that the temperature of Venus is close to 450°C, more than
          on
          Mercury!
          <br>

          Venus is the third brightest object in the sky, after the Sun and the Moon, so the planet is very
          easy to spot among the stars.
          <br>
          Venus, because of the strong percentage of variation of its distance with the Earth, present a strong
          variation
          of its apparent size. For Venus the diameter varies between 10'' and 64''.
          Venus does not have a magnetic field.

        <i>Planet Earth is a miraculous blue dot, an oasis of life in the middle of the vastness of an endless
          universe.<br>
          The age of the Earth is currently estimated at 4,550 million years. The Earth is the only planet whose name
          does
          not come from a Roman or Greek God.<br><br>
          The name Sea would have been more appropriate, given the importance of the oceans in the history of the Earth
          and its occupation of the planet's surface.<br>
          It is in the nebulae that planetary systems are born.
          How a planet is created?<br><br>
          To create a planet we will go in a nebula where the regions of birth abound, we will use two binders, the
          electromagnetic force and the force of gravity, for the remainder it will be necessary to leave time to
          time...<br><br>

          The Earth slides majestically on an ideal orbit, leaving no trace of the formidable force that drives it. We
          fall into infinity, describing spirals that are constantly changing, and we will never return to the place
          where
          we are today. Day and night, while the sky unfolds a changing panorama above our heads, our Earth, this little
          stardust, turns on itself without worrying about tomorrow.<br><br>
          Often it shows us wonderful images like halos, aurora borealis or southern lights...

          <h3>Life on Earth</h3>

          Life is a mysterious and universal tendency of matter to associate, to organize itself, to become more
          complex.
          The living being is characterized by the fact that it draws energy from the external environment, uses this
          energy, rejects waste and enriches its organization. At the scale of species, the living has been constantly
          complexifying for 4.5 billion years.<br> The non-living evolves always with time in the direction of their
          disorganization.<br> It is the growth of entropy (measure of disorder).<br><br>
          The non-living produces entropy and the living produces negative entropy, or negentropy.<br><br>
          Life is nothing more than a banal mechanism, a particular form of matter, the secret of which will certainly
          be
          revealed, as it is so tenacious.<br><br> We note that life evolves in time by taking a path defined by an
          infinity of
          parameters, which makes it indefinable and unpredictable.<br><br> There is however a biological definition of
          life:

          "an organism is said to be alive when it exchanges matter and energy with its environment while maintaining
          its
          autonomy, when it reproduces and evolves by natural selection. "

        <br>
        <i>With a diameter of 6786 km, Mars is much smaller than the Earth. It revolves around the Sun in 687 days. The
          day is hardly longer than on Earth. The rotation axis of Mars is inclined of 25°11'.<br>
          <br>
          There are therefore
          seasons, slightly more marked than on Earth. Mars appears orange-red because of the presence of rust on its
          surface. Located 227,940,000 km from the Sun, its temperature rarely exceeds 0°C. The atmosphere of Mars is so
          thin that there is not enough pressure for water to exist in a liquid state.
          <br>
          <br> These oppositions follow each other at intervals of 2 years and
          50 days. At its farthest distance from the Earth it is 250 million km away.<br>
          <br>
          This beautiful planet appears to the
          eye as a blood-red star, perhaps that is why it is called the God of War. Its revolution around the Sun lasts
          about 700 days. The duration of the day is close to ours 24H37mn. Its axis of rotation is close to ours, 25°.

          <h3>Volcanoes of Mars</h3>

          Mariner 10 has brought back photographs of the surface of Mars with a resolution of 200 meters.<br>
          Mars reveals the
          largest known volcanoes. The relief of Mars is much more varied and tormented than that of our satellite.
          <br>
          <br> The
          largest volcano, Olympus Mons, is 25 km high, 600 km wide and has a crater 20 km in diameter. In the regions
          of
          Tharsis, the volcanoes form alignments like the terrestrial volcanic chains. There are real river canyons,
          with
          tributaries branched into ribs, as on Earth, but these valleys are dry.<br>
          Coprates, the largest canyon, is 3 000
          km long. All its volcanoes have been extinct for 300 million years.
          <br> This planet has known violent seismic
          adventures, its lighter mantle than that of the Earth can release its constraints more easily.
          <br>

          There is no magnetic field and the atmosphere of Mars, composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, has a
          pressure on the ground of about one fifth of the pressure on Earth.

        </h1>
        <i>With an equatorial diameter of 142,984 km, it is by far the largest planet in the solar system. <br> Jupiter
          orbits the Sun in about 11 years and 10 months. Jupiter has
          many satellites, 4 of which are larger than Pluto. They cause frequent eclipses of the Sun on Jupiter that can
          be followed through a telescope from Earth, the largest planet in the solar system is a gas giant planet
          composed of 93% hydrogen and 7% helium.
          <br>
          <br>
          It represents 71% of the total mass of the planets of the solar system.<br>
          It is the fifth planet from the Sun, after Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars. It owes its name to the Roman god
          Jupiter.<br> Visible to the naked eye in the night sky, Jupiter is the fourth brightest object, after the Sun,
          the
          Moon and Venus.<br><br> Occasionally Mars appears brighter than Jupiter and sometimes Jupiter appears brighter
          than
          Venus. As on the other gaseous planets, violent winds, of nearly 600 km/h, run through the upper layers of the
          planet.<br> The famous large red spot, well known to amateurs, is an overpressure zone that has been observed
          for a
          long time.<br><br> Jupiter releases more energy into space than it receives from the Sun (Mass = 318 times the
          Earth).
          Jupiter has played the role of a shield, protecting life on our planet.<br> If Jupiter was not present, the
          bombardment of asteroids on Earth would be 1,000 times more frequent. <br>A meteorite bombardment would take
          place
          every 60,000 years and life would have lacked the stability to flourish, we would be at the bacterial stage.
          The
          presence of a giant planet is of vital importance in a solar system because destructive objects are mainly
          attracted by the giant planet.

          Saturn is known since ancient times, it is
          hot (12 000 °C in the core) and radiates more energy
          into space than
          it receives from the Sun.<br><br> Most of this additional energy is generated by the Kelvin-Helmholtz
          mechanism,

          Note: Saturn represents 35% of the total mass of the planets in the solar system.
          <br><br>

          <h3>Origin of the rings of Saturn</h3>

          The rings of Saturn would come from the dislocation of a large moon. The giant planets are all accompanied by
          rings, but Saturn is for us, the planet with enigmatic rings.
          How were the rings of Saturn formed?<br><br>
          An American researcher, Robin Canup, from the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder (Colorado) thinks he has
          the answer to this question.<br>
          In the article he published in the British journal Nature on December 16, 2010, these rings are the remains of
          a
          large moon disappeared from Saturn.<br>
          This moon would have broken up under the effect of the tidal forces of Saturn. Until now, it was thought that
          the rings were due to the destruction of one or more small satellites, but this did not correspond to the
          composition of the rings, 99% made of water ice<br>. According to Robin Canup, a large satellite of about 5000
          km in
          diameter would have been literally "peeled off" by tidal forces. Its outer layers, composed of ice, would have
          remained in orbit around Saturn, while the core of the satellite would have disintegrated in Saturn's
          atmosphere. The icy debris would have quickly formed the small ice satellites and thus, the rings of Saturn.

        <i>With a diameter of 51,118 km, Uranus is a giant planet much smaller than Jupiter and Saturn.<br> Located at
          2,871,000,000 km from the Sun, it is the first planet discovered with an instrument.<br> Uranus turns on
          itself
          lying on its orbit and around the Sun in 84 years. As soon as we move away from the equator, day and night
          last
          42 years each.<br>
          Uranus is hardly visible to the naked eye on a clear night, it appears, even with powerful
          instruments, as a
          small greenish disk.<br> Uranus is the seventh planet of the solar system, a gas giant and the third in size.
          The
          blue-green colorations of the absorption bands are due to methane. Its appearance reflects the presence of
          high
          altitude clouds of photochemical hydrocarbons which cover the methane haze, which in turn covers clouds of
          hydrogen sulfide and/or ammonia.

          <h3>The 7th planet</h3>

          After having correctly determined the nature of the star, Herschel named it the Georgian Planet in honor of
          King
          George III of England.<br> The name Uranus was first proposed by Johan Elert Bode in conformity with the names
          of
          the other planets and was only accepted in 1850. Uranus showed irregularities in its orbit around the Sun that
          could not be explained by the law of universal gravitation.<br>




          Uranus has rings like the other gas giants, its rings were discovered only in 1979. They are very dark like
          those of Jupiter and composed of relatively large particles, up to 10 meters in diameter in addition to fine
          dust, like the rings of Saturn.<br>
          There are 11 known rings, all very faint, the brightest being the Epsilon ring.<br>

        <i> With a diameter of 49520 km, Neptune is the smallest of the giant planets. Its discovery in 1846 from
          theoretical calculations against a background of Franco-British rivalry is one of the great pages in the
          history
          of astronomy.<br> Neptune is about 4.5 billion km from the Sun. Its average temperature is only -214°C.Neptune
          is
          located at the edge of the solar system, at 4.5 billion km. <br><br>
          <h3>Neptune, the last planet</h3>

          Neptune (Poseidon in Greek, god of the sea) is the 8th and last planet of the solar system and is only
          revealed
          with powerful instruments.<br> It is at an average distance of 4,553,946,490 km from the Sun, (30 times
          farther
          than
          the Earth), its revolution around the Sun lasts 164 years and 280 days, at a speed of 5.45 km/s.<br> The
          French
          astronomer Urbain Le Verrier calculated the hypothetical position in the sky of this eighth planet, which was
          named Neptune.<br> It was discovered in 1846 at the predicted position. Neptune was not discovered by
          observation
          but with pencil and paper from the trajectory and characteristics of Uranus. Neptune like all the Jovian
          planets
          has rings discovered in 1984, but their existence was confirmed by voyager 2 in 1989, 3 main narrow and dark
          rings orbit this planet.<br> The blue color of Neptune is the result of the absorption of red light by the
          methane
          of its atmosphere.<br>
          Neptune's atmosphere is more than 8000 km thick. It is composed mainly of dihydrogen (H2) for 85%, helium (He)
          for 13% and methane (CH4) for 2%.
